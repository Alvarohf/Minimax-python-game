# Minimax-python-game
A game of cutting blocks implemented with a minimax algorithm.
## UI (User interface)
There is an user interface created with pygame, it lets you choose your cut and see the visual representation of the block. It will switch colours in each turn.
## Algorithm Minimax
AI is created by this algorithm, it is a full information algorithm that explores all posible plays. That is why it has been optimized while exploring new nodes (plays). Also it has a system to reduce the block to a size that is easily computable by the algorithm.
